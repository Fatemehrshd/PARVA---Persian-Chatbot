# Features

## Task 1: Full-Stack Project Initialization
- Initialized Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript frontend with Vue Router 4 and Pinia state management.
- Initialized NestJS + TypeScript backend with Express platform adapter and CORS enabled.
- Added environment variable support (`.env` and `.env.example`) for both frontend and backend.
- Added `.gitignore` to prevent secret and build artifact leakage.

## Task 2: UI Overhaul & Responsiveness
- Installed and configured **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn-vue** for the frontend.
- Added **Vazirmatn** font face to the project, ensuring proper Persian (RTL) typography.
- Made the frontend fully responsive.

## Task 3: Auth Page & Shadcn UI Integration
- Replaced modal authentication with dedicated `/login` and `/signup` routes using shadcn-vue components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Label`).
- Fixed ESM compatibility for `tailwind.config.js` and PostCSS bundling in `vite.config.ts`.
- Configured CSS variables and opacity tokens for shadcn-vue.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for `LoginView.vue`.

## Task 4: In-Form Model Picker & Admin Panel Access
- Relocated model selection dropdown from `AppHeader` to the chat composer input form (`ChatComposer.vue`), allowing users to switch models directly where they compose messages.
- Added popover dropdown with upward orientation in composer footer.
- Added direct access links to the Admin Panel (`/admin/models`) in Header, Sidebar, and inside the Models Modal.
- Added unit tests for in-form model selection in `ChatComposer.spec.ts`.

## Task 5: Admin Dashboard Overhaul & Global App Scrolling
- Transformed `/admin/models` into a full-featured Admin Dashboard with KPI metric cards (Total Models, Active Status, Connected Providers, Total Sessions).
- Added interactive toolbar with search filter and provider tabs (All, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Local).
- Built structured data table with status badges and quick actions (Set Default, Delete).
- Fixed root layout in `main.css` (`overflow-y: auto`, `#app min-height: 100vh`) so any page overflowing viewport height scrolls naturally.
- Added unit tests for Admin Dashboard in `AdminModelsView.spec.ts`.

## Task 6: Browser Autocomplete / Autofill Dark Theme Preservation
- Configured `-webkit-autofill` and `:autofill` CSS rules with inset box-shadow and text fill overrides to prevent browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox) from replacing input background and text colors with light yellow/white during autocomplete.

## Task 7: Global Async Loading & Form Control Disabling
- Created global composables `useAsyncAction` and `useLoadingState` (`src/composables/useAsyncAction.ts`) to orchestrate asynchronous execution with automatic `isLoading`, `error` handling, cancellation guards, and cleanup.
- Enhanced `<Button>` with `:loading` and `:disabled` props, rendering an inline SVG spinner and disabling pointer events during loading.
- Enhanced `<Input>` with explicit `disabled` and `loading` props and visual opacity transitions.
- Integrated `useAsyncAction` into AI model registration (both in `AdminModelsView.vue` and `ModelsModal.vue`), automatically disabling all form inputs (`name`, `provider`, `apiIdentifier`), secondary buttons (`cancel`), and the submission button while rendering an active loading spinner until completion.
- Integrated `useAsyncAction` into `LoginView.vue` for sign-in and sign-up flows.
- Added comprehensive unit test suite in `tests/useAsyncAction.spec.ts` and updated `AdminModelsView.spec.ts` and `LoginView.spec.ts`.
